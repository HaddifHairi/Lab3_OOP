this c# console application implements a matrix and vector processing system by translating a formal uml class diagram into functional code .
the architecture enforces strict encapsulation by maintaining all attributes as private and restricting data access to public methods, ensuring object integrity . 
the system utilizes composition for matrix-row structures, aggregation for repository-based storage, and dependency relationships where calculators rely on a dedicated validator to verify dimension compatibility before performing addition . 
by decoupling user input handling from mathematical logic and storage, the program demonstrates a modular approach to object-oriented programming within a single project environment.
